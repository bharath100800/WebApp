                      CarePlus was established in 2010 by Dr. Sarah Johnson, who recognized the growing need for quality home healthcare services. After years of working in traditional healthcare settings, Dr. Johnson witnessed firsthand how many patients struggled with hospital visits, especially the elderly and those with mobility challenges.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      What began as a small team of dedicated nurses has grown into a comprehensive home healthcare provider serving thousands of patients across the region. Throughout our growth, we've maintained our commitment to personalized care and building lasting relationships with our patients.
